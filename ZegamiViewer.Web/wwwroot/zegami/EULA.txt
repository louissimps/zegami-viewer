8.2	The Licensor undertakes at its own expense to defend the Licensee or, at its option, settle any claim or action brought against the Licensee alleging that the possession or use of the Software (or any part thereof, excluding any Open-Source Software) in accordance with the terms of this licence infringes the UK Intellectual Property Rights of a third party (Claim) and shall be responsible for any reasonable losses, damages, costs (including legal fees) and expenses incurred by or awarded against the Licensee as a result of or in connection with any such Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnity in this clause shall not apply where the Claim in question is attributable to possession or use of the Software (or any part thereof) by the Licensee other than in accordance with the terms of this licence, use of the Software in combination with any hardware or software not supplied or specified by the Licensor if the infringement would have been avoided by the use of the Software not so combined, or use of a non-current release of the Software (including due to the Licensee's failure to install a Maintenance Release).

8.3	If any third party makes a Claim, or notifies an intention to make a Claim against the Licensee, the Licensor's obligations under clause 8.2 are conditional on the Licensee:
    (a)	as soon as reasonably practicable, giving written notice of the Claim to the Licensor, specifying the nature of the Claim in reasonable detail;

    (c)	giving the Licensor and its professional advisers access at reasonable times (on reasonable prior notice) to its premises and its officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives or advisers, and to any relevant assets, accounts, documents and records within the power or control of the Licensee, so as to enable the Licensor and its professional advisers to examine them and to take copies (at the Licensor's expense) for the purpose of assessing the Claim; and
    (d)	giving the Licensor full conduct of the Claim.

8.4	If any Claim is made, or in the Licensor's reasonable opinion is likely to be made, against the Licensee, the Licensor may at its sole option and expense:
    (a)	procure for the Licensee the right to continue to use the Software (or any part thereof) in accordance with the terms of this licence;
    (b)	modify the Software so that it ceases to be infringing;
    (c)	replace the Software with non-infringing software; or
    (d)	terminate this licence immediately by notice in writing to the Licensee and refund any of the Fee paid by the Licensee as at the date of termination (less a reasonable sum in respect of the Licensee's use of the Software to the date of termination) on return of the Software and all copies thereof.
